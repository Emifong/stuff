        <h1>Project 1: Oblique Strategies</h1>
        <p>Group Name: Group Art 103 from Art 103</p>
        <p>Members: Vana, Austin, Guadalupe, Charli, Emily F.(ME)</p>
<br>

        <p><i>"Change instrument roles"</i></p>
        <br>
    
        <p> For oblique strategies, we generated three strategies and had to choose one. So our three choices were: </p>
        <p>1) Not building a wall but making a brick </p>
        <p>2) Change intrument roles</p>
        <p>3) What mistakes did you make last time?</p>
        <br>

        <p>Of course, from the heading above, we chose number 2. Number 1 didn't ring any ideas for us and number 3
            involved us being vulnerable. So number 2 was just right for us. We brainstormed ideas about tools and
            objects that switch roles or change their intended purpose. From the brainstorm we came up with the concepts
            below.</p>
